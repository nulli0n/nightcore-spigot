# About
![](https://repo.nightexpressdev.com/api/badge/latest/releases/su/nightexpress/nightcore/nightcore?color=40c14a&name=nightcore&prefix=v)

**nightcore** is a lightweight library plugin that provides a wide set of utilities to make plugin development faster and more efficient.

We always move forward and therefore use only **modern APIs** and features provided with Spigot/Paper updates. Say "no" to slow legacy code!

There is **no impact** on server's performance, nightcore **doesn't** handle or store any data.

All nightcore powered plugins are clean and lightweight. There is no metrics, update checkers, data collectors, DRM systems or advertisements.

# Requirements
- **Java 21** or higher.
